== AsysC (Analog System Compiler)

_ASysC_ is a tool that has slowly evolved over the years to the point where it can be used to simulate electronic systems. 
Strictly speaking, _ASysC_ does not simulate the electronic system, but it is capable of assembling the equations of components declared in a netlist into a global system of equations, which it then solves symbolically. Once this stage has been completed, it will generate _Python_ code, which will then be used to simulate the circuit itself. Unlike other simulators mentioned in the introduction, _ASysC_ does not solve systems in matrix form, thus avoiding excessive memory usage.

=== How does a CAS work?

In a CAS, mathematical expressions are stored in tree form. For example, the expression stem:[-(a-b)] will be stored internally as follows:

[.text-center] 
[mermaid]
....
---
config:
  theme: neutral
  look: neo
---
flowchart TB
    subgraph a [ ]
    direction TB
    A((\-)) --> B((\-))
    B --> C((a))
    B --> D((b))
    end
....

A CAS contains a set of rules that allow you to perform transformations on the trees. 

For example, there is a simplification rule that transforms the expression stem:[-(a-b)] into b-a. This rule is simply written stem:[-(a-b):= (b-a)].

It transforms the input tree into a simplified output tree:

[.text-center] 
[mermaid]
....
---
config:
  theme: neutral
  look: neo
---
flowchart LR
    subgraph a [ ]
        direction TB
        A((\-)) --> B((\-))
        B --> C((a))
        B --> D((b))
    end
    subgraph b [ ]
        direction TB
        E((\-)) 
        E --> F((b))
        E --> G((a))
    end
    a --"Simplification"--> b
....

Parameters **a** and **b** can be either numbers, variables or expressions themselves formed by sub-trees.

For example, the expression stem:[-((3+x)-(z+5))] is recognized as being of the form stem:[-(a-b)], and is therefore transformed by the rule in question into stem:[(z+5)-(3+x)], which visually translates into the following transformation:

[.text-center] 
[mermaid]
....
---
config:
  theme: neutral
  look: neo
---
flowchart LR
    subgraph a [ ]
        direction TB
        A((\-)) --> B((\-))
        B --> C((\+))
        B --> D((\+))
        C --> H((3))
        C --> I((x))
        D --> J((z))
        D --> K((5))
    end
    subgraph b [ ]
        direction TB
        E((\-)) 
        E --> F((\+))
        E --> G((\+))
        F --> L((z))
        F --> M((5))
        G --> N((3))
        G --> O((x))
    end
    a --"Simplification"--> b
....

This example illustrates a simple rule, but sophisticated transformations are possible with more complex rules that interact with each other recursively. This set of rules can be used to solve equations, linear systems, Taylor series calculations and more.


=== CAS rules overview

==== Introduction

_ASysC_ is built on a very simple system of rules, which can be used to perform a whole range of mathematical operations, such as :

- simplification of expressions,
- solving one- or two-degree equations,
- solving systems,
- matrix operations,
- determinant calculations,
- Taylor series decompositions.

To go even further and enable it to solve electronic circuits, _ASysC_ also integrates the rules needed to apply Kirchhoff's laws, as well as fundamental transformations in electronics, such as derivatives and integrals transformations for frequency and transient analysis, and linearization of non-linear functions. 

For system solving, _ASysC_ contains rules that support several system solving algorithms:

- Gauss-Jordan elimination method,
- Resolution by Cramer's method, also known as the determinant method.

Although both methods are implemented, it is the latter that will be preferred for solving systems of equations, as the results produced are compatible with the equations governing switch models (either voltage is zero, or current is zero, which presents a physical singularity). If we use the Gauss Pivot method, the structure of the equations obtained is different, and we may end up with divisions by zero when evaluating these equations. This is the case, for example, with a circuit containing an ideal diode (either zero voltage or zero current). On the other hand, solving a system with Cramer's method has the disadvantage of being much slower than with the Gauss-Jordan method.

==== Rule definition files

A large number of rules are available, some generic, others specialized for electronic circuits. These rules are contained in a set of files in text format (*+*.rule+*)

[horizontal]
units.rule:: rules on units,
components.rule:: definition of analog components,
ic.rule:: mixed components, such as the NE555.
electricity.rule:: transformations for frequency and time analysis, as well as Kirchhoff's laws,
includes.rule:: input files for rule definitions,
logic.rule:: some logic components: AND, OR, XOR gates and D and SR flip-flops,
matrix_vector.rule:: rules for operations on vectors and matrices,
main.rule:: basic algebraic rules,
symbols.rule:: definition of operator symbols,
derivatives.rule:: derivative transformations,
tests.rule:: non-regression tests

==== Structure of a rule

Let's take a look at some concrete examples of how a *CAS* works.
As a first example, let's use it as a simple calculator:

    cd lightcas/bin
    ./asysc
    *************************************
    *** ASysC Console                 ***
    *** (C) Cyril Collineau 2006-2025 ***
    *************************************
    Type “help” for help.
    > 2*2
    4

Second example more complex, variable assignment:

    > b:=a+a
    2*a
    > a:=2
    2
    > b
    4

We can see here that stem:[b] initially accepts the value stem:[2 times a] without knowing the value of stem:[a]. This is the fundamental difference between a *CAS* and a calculator. It's when we specify that stem:[a] is equal to stem:[2], that stem:[b] displays the value stem:[4]. 

In _ASysC_, a rule is always defined with the assignment operator *:=*. 

Third example, the declaration of a simple function with two parameters, an addition:

    > my_sum( a, b) := a + b
    > my_sum(2, 3)
    5

Let's go a step further and declare a symbolic transformation, like the slightly absurd example below, which associates multiplication with addition via the 'f' transformation. Here, the parameter is no longer a variable but a tree made up of the *+* operator and two parameters *a* and *b* :

    > f(a+b):=a*b
    a*b
    > f(2+4)     
    8

This feature as strange as it may seem enables _ASysC_ to perform all kinds of transformations on trees, by performing tree pattern recognition followed by tree substitution.

[.text-center] 
[mermaid]

config:
  theme: neutral
  look: neo

flowchart LR
    subgraph a [ ]
        direction TB
        B((\+))
        B --> C((a))
        B --> D((b))
    end
    subgraph b [ ]
        direction TB
        E((\*)) 
        E --> F((a))
        E --> G((b))
    end
    a --"f"--> b
....

For common calculations, pre-configured rules are available.

Example of derivative calculation with the *DER()* function:

    > DER(COS(3*x),x)
    -(3*SIN(3*x))

Example of writing a function as a Taylor sequence with the *TAYLOR()* function:

    > TAYLOR(COS(x),x,0,10)
    1-2.7557319224e-07*x^10+2.48015873016e-05*x^8-0.00138888888889*x^6+0.0416666666667*x^4-0.5*x^2

Example of solving equations with function *SOLVE()* :

    > SOLVE(x-2,x)
    2
    > SOLVE(x^2-2*x+4,x)
    {1-1.73205080757*j(),1+1.73205080757*j()}

Example of solving systems of equations :

    > SOLVE({x-y+1,x+y-5},{x,y})
    {2,3}

Another interesting capability of _ASysC_ is its support for lists. This expression is used to define components and circuits, as we'll see in the following chapters:

    > my_list := {a;b;c}

==== Recursions with rules

Rules can be called recursively as follows:

    > my_factorial( x ) := x * my_factorial( x - 1 )
    my_factorial(x-1)*x

This capability makes it possible to perform complex transformations. But using this rule alone will result in infinite recursion. To avoid this, we need to add a specific rule for the stop condition:

    > my_factorial( 1 ) := 1 
    1

If you look at the rules described in the files (*+*.rule+*) located in the `lightcas/rules` directory, you'll see that the vast majority of rules are recursive.

Now try `my_factorial(6)` for example:

    > my_factorial( 6 )
    720

You get stem:[720], which is the correct result of stem:[6!]

== Compilation, installation and use

=== Compilation and installation

Compiling _ASysC_ is normally straightforward. It requires no external dependencies other than *g++* and *make* executables. A simple invocation of the make command in the root directory suffices:

[source,bash]
----
    git clone https://github.com/analog-system-compiler/asysc.git
    cd asysc
    git submodule update --init
    make
----

_ASysC_ has been compiled and tested under both *Linux* and *MSYS2* environments. Once compiled under Linux, its size does not exceed 100Kb. This is not the tool you'll hesitate to remove from your hard disk because it takes up too much space!

Once the code has been compiled, the Makefile will automatically generate the _Python_ files needed to simulate the circuits. This operation can sometimes take several seconds.

Before going any further, check that the *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* libraries are installed in your _Python_ environment.

=== _ASysC_ command-line options

The `asysc` command accepts the following options:
    
[horizontal, labelwidth=4]    
-i:: input file (*+*,cir+*)
-o:: output file (*+*.py+*). If omitted, output will be in a file with the same name as the input file but with the *.py* file extension.
-t:: type of analysis: *ac* or *trans*.
-c:: name of the circuit to be analyzed. By default: "CIRCUIT".

Example :
[source,bash]
----
    ../lightcas/bin/asysc -i ac/RLC/RLC.cir -o ac/RLC/RLC.py -t ac
----

This example will create a _Python_ model for frequency analysis from the input file *RLC.cir*. 
The process is described in more detail in the following paragraphs.

=== Applying _ASysC_ to electronics

==== From equations to simulation

As mentioned previously, _ASysC_ is not a simulator, but a tool for manipulating algebraic expressions. Used on its own, it is unable to perform a simulation. To perform this step, we'll be using the _Python_ language and the popular *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* libraries. *NumPy* will be used for complex mathematical calculations, while *Matplotlib* will be used to display the results graphically. Any other graphics library can be used if desired.

To summarize, the process steps are as follows:

    . the circuit is described in text format (**+*.cir+** or **+*.rule+**),
    . this description is given to the _ASysC_ compiler, which analyzes the circuit, solves the equation system and creates a behavioral model in _Python_,
    . this _Python_ model is then executed for simulation,
    . once the simulation is complete, _Python_ displays the results graphically.

This is illustrated below:

A("Circuit description \(\*.cir/\*.rule\)")
B("Circuit behavior model in _Python_ language")
C("Results are displayed with MatPlotLib")
A -- Compilation with _ASysC_ -->B --Model execution--> C
----

It's best not to modify the _Python_ file generated by _ASysC_, as it will be overwritten. For simulation purposes, this file cannot be used on its own; it must be supplemented by two other _Python_ files:

[horizontal]
*circuit_base.py*:: this file contains the basic classes for circuit simulation. It is common to all simulated circuits.
*simulation.py*:: this file contains the simulation and display functions for *Matplotlib*. It is specific to the circuit and simulation run. The user modifies it according to the simulation and can customize display as desired.

The great advantage of using _Python_ for simulation is that all simulation data is accessible directly in *NumPy* arrays. It is therefore possible to take advantage of the power of this library to carry out other processes, such as applying a Fourier transform following a transient analysis for instance.

=== Declaring a component

The fundamental idea behind _ASysC_ is to consider that:

- a circuit is a function that returns a list of components, 
- a component is a function that returns a list of equations. 

In short, all is based on functions! This incredibly simple mechanism offers almost limitless possibilities.

Hereafter, the term *rule* rather than *function* is used, which is a more appropriate term for a *CAS*, even though it's basically the same thing.
Thus, a component will be defined as a rule comprising a list of equations, as follows:

----
my_component( node1, node2, ..., noden, parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameteren ) := {
    
    equation1;
    equation2;
    ...
}
----

Here's a concrete example for a resistor *R1* connected to nodes *node_p* and *node_n* :

image::across_through.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

The resistor component declaration contains three equations:

    - an equation for defining the potential at nodes *node_p* and *node_n* using the *ACROSS()* function. This function will be used to determine the voltage in the circuit by applying the Kirchhoff's loop rule.
    - an equation to define the current between nodes *node_p* and *node_n*. With the *THROUGH()* function. This function will be used to determine the current in the circuit by applying the Kirchhoff's junction rule.
    - an equation describing the physical relationship between current and voltage. In the case of a resistor, we have : stem:[U=R*I].

This gives the following declaration for the resistor:

----
NAME.CR(node_p, node_n, R) := {

    NAME.U = ACROSS(node_p, node_n);
    NAME.I = THROUGH(node_p,node_n);
    NAME.U = R*NAME.I

};
----

This representation is quite similar to the _VHDL-AMS_ language, in which the keywords *accross* and *through* are used.
In the same way as for resistors, the declaration of an inductance uses the *DER()* function to declare a derivative:

----
NAME.CL(node_p, node_n, L) := {

    NAME.U = ACROSS(node_p, node_n);
    NAME.I = THROUGH(node_p, node_n);
    NAME.U = L * DER(NAME.I, t)

};
----

And for the declaration of a capacitor :

----
NAME.CC(node_p, node_n, C) := {

    NAME.U = ACROSS(node_p, node_n);
    NAME.I = THROUGH(node_p, node_n);
    NAME.I = C * DER(NAME.U, t)

};
----

Note that "*.*"" is a hierarchical operator that will propagate the instance name throughout the component's internal equations, to avoid ending up with variables with identical names when all equations are extracted for system resolution. 

Thus, *NAME* will be replaced by *R1* and the instantiation *R1.CR* will replace the voltage *NAME.U* by *R1.U* and the current *NAME.I* by *R1.I*.

[NOTE]
====
1. Prefixing nodes with the *@* character is not mandatory. This is used to identify the nodes in the parameter list, to provide a little clarity. Nothing prevents you from noting your nodes "my_node1", "my_node2", etc.

2. The attentive reader will have noticed the absence of a semicolon "*;*" in the last line. The semicolon is used as a list separator *{ ; ; }* and therefore MUST not appear at the end of the last line of your circuit declaration.
====


=== Instantiating a component

A component instantiation is written in the following form:

    <Instance name>.<Component name>( <node list>, <parameter list>)

For example, for a resistance of type *CR* of name *R1*, value *1K* the instantiation will be written as follows:
    
    R1.CR( @3, @4, 1K)

=== Quantities

_ASysC_ also manages the sizes for better readability. The quantities supported are:

[horizontal]
p     ::  pico
n     ::  nano
u     ::  micro
m     ::  milli
k or K::  kilo
M     ::  mega
G     ::  giga

So if you write *1G* for example, it will correspond to the value *1000000000*.
