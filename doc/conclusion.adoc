== Conclusion

With a simple C++ executable of about a hundred kilobytes and a hundred lines of _Python_, it is possible to create an analog simulator capable of performing both time and frequency simulations. This solution also allows for the creation of components from algebraic formulations, which can then be hierarchically organized to form more complex components and grouped into libraries.

The results obtained from simulations can be customized using the *Matplotlib* library, allowing them to be displayed either on a single graph or on separate graphs with distinct scales.

_ASysC_ offers an interesting alternative to more complex commercial simulators, offering significant flexibility for creation and experimentation. It is portable and compatible with both Linux and Windows.

While it may not match the performance of simulators like *Spice* and others, due to the complexity and time required for solving equations, it still provides valuable capabilities.

Since the simulation is conducted in _Python_, users can easily process the results, perform operations like Fourier transforms (*FFT*), and conduct measurements at specific points to identify optimal conditions. Additionally, users can run multiple simulations with different sets of random parameters, similar to a Monte Carlo approach. It also allows for direct modification of variables through _Python_ code to observe how the system reacts.

Additionally, _ASysC_ can be integrated with *CocoTB* <<R11>>, another _Python_-based tool designed to facilitate the testing of modules written in _VHDL_ and _Verilog_. This integration allows for the simultaneous simulation of both analog and digital processes. The combination of these tools opens up exciting new possibilities, enabling the creation of advanced test benches for developers working with mixed analog/digital systems.

_ASysC_ is still an experimental tool and lacks many essential features needed to transform it into a full professional tool.
