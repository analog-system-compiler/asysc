== Conclusion

Despite its small executable size of roughly 100 kilobytes, _ASysC_, when combined with _Python_ libraries like *Matplotlib* and *NumPy*, can perform both time-domain and frequency-domain simulations of components defined through algebraic expressions. These components can be structured hierarchically to form more complex systems and organized into reusable libraries.

Simulation results can be customized with *Matplotlib*, allowing them to be displayed on a single graph or on separate graphs with distinct scales.

_ASysC_ provides an interesting alternative to more complex commercial simulators, offering significant flexibility for creation and experimentation. It is portable and compatible with both Linux and Windows.

While it may not match the performance of simulators like *Spice* and others, it still provides valuable capabilities. Since the simulation runs in _Python_, users can easily process the results, perform operations like Fourier transforms (*FFT*), and conduct measurements at specific points to identify optimal conditions. Additionally, users can run multiple simulations with different sets of random parameters, similar to a Monte Carlo approach. It also allows for direct modification of variables through _Python_ code to observe how the system reacts.

Moreover, _ASysC_ can be integrated with *CocoTB* <<R11>>, another _Python_-based tool designed to facilitate the testing of modules written in _VHDL_ and _Verilog_. This integration allows for the simultaneous simulation of both analog and digital processes. The combination of these tools opens up exciting new possibilities, enabling the creation of advanced test benches for developers working with mixed analog/digital systems.

_ASysC_ is still an experimental tool and lacks many essential features needed to transform it into a full professional tool.

// ASysC presents a flexible alternative to more complex commercial simulators, making it well-suited for experimentation and system design. It is portable and runs on both Linux and Windows.

// While it may not match the computational performance of simulators like Spice, it still offers valuable capabilities. Since the simulation runs in Python, users can easily process results, apply operations such as Fourier transforms (FFT), and perform targeted measurements to identify optimal conditions. Moreover, it supports running multiple simulations with randomized parameters, akin to a Monte Carlo approach. Users can also modify variables dynamically within the Python code to analyze system responses in real time.

// Furthermore, ASysC can integrate with CocoTB <<R11>>, a Python-based framework for testing modules written in VHDL and Verilog. This integration enables the simultaneous simulation of analog and digital processes, opening up new possibilities for developing sophisticated test benches in mixed-signal environments.

// Currently, ASysC remains an experimental tool and lacks several key features required for professional-grade applications.
